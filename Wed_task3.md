**Question 1: Describe four roles of the Operating systems in a computer.**

    Intermediaries: Operating system is an interface between software  and hardware. Also it develops a software abstraction  through APIs called device drivers to     handle input and output and control the peripherals. 

    Multitasking: It allows one big batch to have many programs running simultaneously on a single computer.

    Memory management: OS system can  allocate each program its own  block of memory by using the method of ‚Äúvirtual memory‚Äù. Virtual memory allows programs to         have flexible memory sizes that appear to be continuous to them. It simplifies everything and offers tremendous flexibility to the OS in running multiple programs simultaneously.

    Memory protection:  Operating systems  can protect memory from malwares or viruses, which means other processes who are not allocated to  before can‚Äôt access the memory.
